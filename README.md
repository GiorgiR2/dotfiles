# Dotfiles

My Personal dotfiles, configurations...

Software I currently use:
 - Web browser - brave
 - Shell - zsh
 - Terminal - kitty
 - Terminal multiplexer - tmux
 - Text editor - neovim
 - File manager - ranger
 - Window manager - i3

## Getting started

Running following commands will make symlinks for config files, install packages, change wallpaper, etc.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GiorgiR2/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles

# install all packages/apps
bash ./install.sh

# add dotfiles (symlinks)
bash ./setup.sh
```
